    "# 1. Living Labs\n",
    "\n",
    "A living lab can be established using existing infrastructure and data sources. This was shown in the example of the Andorra living lab which made use of CDRs, credit card transactions, and public transportation data. While direct user engagement may be limited, their behaviors - especially their reactions to new products or experimental interventions - can be observed in this setting. Living labs can also be entirely virtual, as is the case in the A/B testing of web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the bleeding edge of living lab development is driven by the growing data collection and interaction capabilities that have been enabled by the spread of ubiquitous computing, this is not a prerequisite for big or electronic data. In Video 2 Professor Alex Pentland discusses an example of how Nike leverages living labs to determine which shoes to release within their stores. You can also refer to [Hack-MIT](http://livinglab.mit.edu/hack-mit/) as an example of how to use existing infrastructure, such as WiFi access points, as a simple living lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization can take many forms. You can refer to [this](https://github.com/hariharsubramanyam/mit-wifi-data-vis) example of a visualization of WiFi data. Once you have the basic lab in place, you would generally build your use case around it. Marketers would likely be interested in the density and profiles of individuals in specific areas, and the resulting efficiency of campaigns or other interventions, while city planners may be interested in optimizing flow in public spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the data that was used in this course was generated by sophisticated deployments which collected not only **big** data, but also **deep** data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another recent trend in technology, the \"[Internet of Things](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/internet-of-things/)\" (or \"IoT\"), holds significant opportunities for data collection and interaction with the environment, whether human or device based. The big shift here is that the end-points are becoming active and they contain computation capabilities, where previous efforts focused on sensors or observations alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The presence of computation capabilities at the end-points also opens up opportunities such as software-defined products. Consider activity trackers learning to recognize new activities, or self-driving cars where new features such as parking capabilities can be added with software updates. Once you have gathered data and refined your algorithms, these can potentially be implemented as software-defined products or features (like the one above) can be added using this mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about the European Open Living Labs network [here](http://www.openlivinglabs.eu/), and another example of a recent deployment of a living lab using sensor and mobile data, the Amsterdam IoT Living Lab, [here](http://iotlivinglab.com/).

[Dark data](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/dark-data/) refers to data that is already available, but not utilized. IoT also contains a number of relevant concepts.
